User Stories
User will be able to search for board games to compare based on key statistics to help choose the one they would like to play.
Meant to help people decide which board game to play and randomly selects one for those who can't decide.


Development Schedule:
  July 18 - Pre Work
    Get idea approved
    Decide which API would work best through reading documentation and testing by grabbing data
    Figure out how to make repo on git hub and how to host site there
    Look into possible complex user interface modules such as a carousel, drag and drop, a sticky nav, tooltips, etc
    Start basic layout to be able to get API/AJAX functionality up and running

  July 19 - MVP Stage 1
    Make notes to README with each git commit
    Work out the API/AJAX functionality for search
      Preferred if possible: Have the search grab the game ID for a more detailed query if possible (rather than user having to get the name just right)
    Work out basic responsive design element for move from mobile to desktop
    Work on basic styling as necessary


  July 20 - MVP Stage 2
    Make Notes to README with each git commit
    Work on complex user interface module (at least one) for displaying search results/data
    Finalize styling on mobile
    Work on responsive design more fully

  July 21 - Wrapping up and Additions
    Make Notes to README with each git commit
    Finalize responsive design
    Make sure API is still working as intended
    Add animation if possible
    Finalize README

  July 22 - Presentation
    Work on presentation flow and materials (rough outline, docs and windows needed)
    Tie up any last details
    Add animation or opening screen if time allows (other things wrapped up before lunch), otherwise just fine tune whats already there.
