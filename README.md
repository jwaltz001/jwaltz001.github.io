# Decide & Play
## Board game application

* Decide and play allows you to search for the board games you want to play, and helps you decide which one would be best based on key statistics. A random choose feature is provided for even faster decisions, or if your group still cant decide.
* Other features currently supported include: links to rules for each game (where possible), videos of YouTube videos about the game.
