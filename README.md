# Decide & Play [![Board game application]]

* Decide and play allows you to search for the board games you want to play, and helps you decide which one would be best based on key statistics. A random choose feature is provided for even faster decisions, or if your group still cant decide.
* Other features currently supported include: links to rules for each game (where possible).
